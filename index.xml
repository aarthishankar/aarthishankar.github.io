      <description>A paper : Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (CUMTD) is a public transportation system that has established itself as a crucial sociotechnical system for the millions of riders commuting within and around the area. To fulfill its commitment of utilising the most progressive technology to support its passengers, CUMTD has been offering open-source developer resources for anyone who would like to improve upon its arsenal of current applications (apps).
These apps have helped CUMTD’s users better navigate its transit system, but have created some downfalls with their experiences with the system as well.</description>

      <description>Eliminating the rampant corruption and improving the pathetic state of public infrastructure building in developing and underdeveloped countries are the primary objectives of this project. We aim to achieve the objective by bringing greater transparency in public sector projects. This project proposes a system to capture all bids for public infrastructure projects on the blockchain. All activities on the project, right from the call for tender, procurement of material, choice of contractor, the status of work will be stored on the blockchain.</description>

      <guid>https://aarthishankar.github.io/projects/creations/pedestrian-vehicle-interaction/</guid>
      <description>Real-time surveillance video from traffic cameras was taken as an input, and was split into frames. An algorithm was designed to extract HOG and GLCM features from the images and classify using Multi-Class Support Vector Machines and Parallel Algorithms. This trained model was used to detect pedestrian-vehicle interaction.</description>

      <guid>https://aarthishankar.github.io/projects/creations/toxic-comments-classifier/</guid>
      <description>Using a labelled data set comprising of Wikipedia’s Talk page comments, a model was trained to categorize toxic comments into two categories - toxic and threat. This model was then proposed as a means to auto-hide toxic and threat comments from social media platforms (chrome plug-in under development).</description>
