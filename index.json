[{"categories":null,"contents":"A paper : Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (CUMTD) is a public transportation system that has established itself as a crucial sociotechnical system for the millions of riders commuting within and around the area. To fulfill its commitment of utilising the most progressive technology to support its passengers, CUMTD has been offering open-source developer resources for anyone who would like to improve upon its arsenal of current applications (apps).\nThese apps have helped CUMTD’s users better navigate its transit system, but have created some downfalls with their experiences with the system as well. The availability of these tools and the simple app review process have caused CUMTD to offer more than a dozen apps with different names with similar functionalities to appear on CUMTD’s App Garage. Also, most of these apps have become obsolete without new features and bug fixes, because of the third-party developers leaving the apps after their completion. These issues have caused the users to speak out against the apps’ user interface and technology support. This paper will address these issues in detail and offer possible solutions to mitigate them. These solutions include hiring an analysis and development teams to inspect app reviews and develop a consolidated app to reduce confusion and redundancy. Also, the team offers methods to mitigate the user interface and technology issues identified through surveys and app reviews and discusses the issues that may arise with these changes. The current CUMTD apps and its process work, but the suggestions offered by the team would improve their current state to better CUMTD customers’ experiences.\n","permalink":"https://aarthishankar.github.io/publications/appdevmasstransit/","tags":null,"title":"Redesigning the Application Development Process of Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Eliminating the rampant corruption and improving the pathetic state of public infrastructure building in developing and underdeveloped countries are the primary objectives of this project. We aim to achieve the objective by bringing greater transparency in public sector projects. This project proposes a system to capture all bids for public infrastructure projects on the blockchain. All activities on the project, right from the call for tender, procurement of material, choice of contractor, the status of work will be stored on the blockchain. By opening up the blockchain to the public it will be a fully transparent system. Since the data is stored on the blockchain, it is immutable and each and every update can be traced to the person who made the update and can be independently verified. By publicly disclosing the status of infrastructure and government projects, a greater degree of accountability can be achieved. In order to do this, we introduce a system called TRANSPR, a consensus-based blockchain network. The design of the system is laid out, and the mechanism by which the system maintains state is elaborated. The coin distribution process is also detailed, and the formulae are laid out. As the system is consensus-based, new blocks are created by consensus decisions and not mining. As there’s no mining or proof of work involved, energy needs of TRANSPR are very less, and it is environmentally sustainable.The major difficulty in the rollout of TRANSPR will be in the adoption phase, as it involves an overhaul of existing processes.\n","permalink":"https://aarthishankar.github.io/publications/transpr/","tags":null,"title":"TRANSPR - Transforming Public Accountability through Block-Chain Technology"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Created visualization using power BI and built dashboards to effectively tell a story about the number of active Facebook users and its trend.\n","permalink":"https://aarthishankar.github.io/projects/creations/analysis-and-visualisation-of-facebook-user-data/","tags":["Power BI","Data Analytics"],"title":"Analysis and Visualisation of Facebook user data"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Using a labelled data set (Wisconsin breast cancer diagnostic data) of cancer patients and the various attributes of a cell such as radius, texture, area, perimeter etc, a model was trained to predict the possibility of a cell being cancerous using Logistic Regression and K-fold cross validation.\n","permalink":"https://aarthishankar.github.io/projects/creations/breast-cancer-risk-prediction/","tags":["Python","Data Analytics","numpy","pandas","Regression"],"title":"Breast Cancer Risk Prediction"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Analysed the San Francisco crime database using the K-Means clustering algorithm, to predict the most crime-prone neighbourhoods.\n","permalink":"https://aarthishankar.github.io/projects/creations/crime-rate-prediction-using-k-means/","tags":["R","Data Analytics","Clustering"],"title":"Crime Rate prediction using K-Means"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Visualizing Infant mortality rate in countries across the world, by processing the data and plotting it on Google Earth.\n","permalink":"https://aarthishankar.github.io/projects/creations/googleearth/","tags":["R","Google Earth"],"title":"Google Earth Visualization for Infant Mortality rate"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Real-time surveillance video from traffic cameras was taken as an input, and was split into frames.
