      <description>Real-time surveillance video from traffic cameras was taken as an input, and was split into frames. An algorithm was designed to extract HOG and GLCM features from the images and classify using Multi-Class Support Vector Machines and Parallel Algorithms. This trained model was used to detect pedestrian-vehicle interaction.</description>

      <guid>https://aarthishankar.github.io/projects/creations/toxic-comments-classifier/</guid>
      <description>Using a labelled data set comprising of Wikipediaâ€™s Talk page comments, a model was trained to categorize toxic comments into two categories - toxic and threat. This model was then proposed as a means to auto-hide toxic and threat comments from social media platforms (chrome plug-in under development).</description>
